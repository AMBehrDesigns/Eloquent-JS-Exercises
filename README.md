# Eloquent-JS-Exercises 
These are my solutions to the exercises found in the book _Eloquent JavaScript_ by Marijn Haverbeke. Each solution has a short comment about what the goal of the program was. If there are any errors or if you have suggestions on how to improve the code, feel free to contact me! I am here to learn.
